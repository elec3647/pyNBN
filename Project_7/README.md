# Project 7
## Error Correction Algorithm (ErrCor)
Advanced Intelligent Systems (ELEC 7970)

**DUE:  April 20**

1. Please download theErrCor MATLAB package from [http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~wilambm/ais/projects/ErrCor\_ribbonDemo.zip](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~wilambm/ais/projects/ErrCor_ribbonDemo.zip)

and unpack it to a selected directory. The code approximate the ribbon function, but your goal is to approximate the peaks function.

1. Write a script to train peaks function using 2000 data points for training and 1000 data point for verification. Report the RMSE values for both cases.
2. Please modify the _prepare\_data.m_ (used in previous projects) script to generate 30\*30 grid points so you may then plot the resulted surface.
3. Plot the resulted speaks function in 30 x 30 mesh using the _mesh.m_ function. Calculate the RMSE value.
